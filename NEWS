    o	Corrected sessionInfo test which did not handle package
	suggestions spanning multiple lines.

    o	Reverted import of 'cobs' package back as package dependency.


NEW FEATURES

    o	Added new normalize() tests. Updated all test result
	comparison files, integrating new data package location.


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.5.7


BUG FIXES

    o	Finally figured out the right incantation to document
	S4 replacement methods in Usage section.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.5.5


BUG FIXES

    o	Both high-level normalize() generic methods were broken.
	Modified the normalize(RPPASet) method to now simply require
	the object itself; other arguments are defaulted using values
	from the object's RPPANormalizationParams slot. The
	normalize(MatrixLike) method was missing match.arg() on the
	'method' argument.


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.5.4


BUG FIXES

    o	Fix for registration invocations in .onLoad() method
	requiring 'methods' package be available.

    o	Updated datasets with 'xz' compression.

    o	Updated saved test output files using R-2.15.3. Added
	pseudo-test to record sessionInfo() output.

    o	Significantly updated documentation, though it introduced
	warning about missing alias for certain S4 replacement methods.


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.5.0


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o	Normalization routines now part of standard processing.

    o	Added support for ArrayPro quantification software.

    o	Many class definitions were changed, which may cause issues
	attempting to load previously saved datafiles.

    o	Dropped compatibility for anything less than R-2.15 as
	no longer able to test against previous versions of R.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.4.5


NEW FEATURES

    o	Added SVN revision information to most of the package files.

    o	Added COPYRIGHTS file.


BUG FIXES

    o	Patch for partial argument name matching.


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.4.4


BUG FIXES

    o	Patched for setGeneric() invocation issue with "image" which
	caused compatibility issue with initial release of R-2.15.0;
	later patched versions ran the original code without issue.


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.4.3


BUG FIXES

    o	Corrected code that generated QC probabilities output
	file. The probabilities may be associated with the wrong
	filenames if any portion of the analysis failed for other
	slides.

    o	Changed output filename for normalized concentrations to
	match upcoming naming convention.


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.4.2


BUG FIXES

NEW FEATURES

    o	Added QC plot displaying slide quality probabilities to
	standard processing.


BUG FIXES

    o	Corrected minor issue when plotting where current device
	was not being set correctly during fit graph generation.


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.4.0


NEW FEATURES

    o	Released to production.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.3.12


BUG FIXES

    o	Now resets par() to display two plots per window prior to any
	new fit graph rendering attempts (PNG generation) for each slide.
	This should correct issue reported by Doris.


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.3.11


BUG FIXES

    o	Patch return of match.call() for RPPASet() invocation to
	always substitute generic 'monitor' argument.

    o	Added additional reporting in case of errors when generating
	fit graphs (in response to issue reported by Doris).


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.3.10


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o	Significant speedup performing fit processing when using
	SuperCurveGUI. Reporting slide fit progress was way too
	expensive.


NEW FEATURES

    o	Use of 'software' option to RPPASet() method with the value
	"singlesubgrid" now reorders the summary CSV files for
	concentrations so that the order of both match.

    o   Added 'software', 'design' and 'version' slots to RPPASetSummary
        object.


BUG FIXES

    o	Modified RPPAFit() to report progress on 5% increments
	during fit series processing (performance).

    o	Modified code performing ImageMagick preflight check to
	handle R-2.12 changes to system() method (which was causing
	package's .onLoad() method to fail).

    o	Removed 'SubgridAlias' as summarizable column for
	summary(RPPADesign) method.


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.3.9


BUG FIXES

    o	Fixed bug dealing with generating Pre-Fit QC summary file.

    o	Fixed bug causing SuperCurveGUI to report failure after
	completing SuperCurve processing.

    o	Added check for valid design after reading slides to ensure
	at least one RPPA object was created in RPPASet() generator.

    o	Fixed (longstanding) bug dealing with slides with extremely
	weak signal. Median polish processing blows up if NA values
	are present in RPPASetSummary() generator, which prevents
	text output files from being written.


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.3.8


BUG FIXES

    o	Patched dir.writable() method to overcome issues with
	server-mounted directories sometimes reporting incorrect
	write permissions.

    o	Fixed is.RPPAPreFitQC() method (inheritance checking).

    o	Added missing documentation for rppaSingleSubgrid data
	(accidentally left out of previous release) and attribution
	for related research papers.



		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.3.7


NEW FEATURES

    o	Pre-Fit QC class was virtualized so that additional
	models could also be handled (in the future).

    o	RPPASet() method is now tracks completion of all stages;
	invoking write.summary() method now outputs an additional
	TSV file that summarizes processing of each slide.

    o	Elapsed time integrated into progress monitoring.

    o	System requirement of ImageMagick binary checked on load,
	providing a warning.

    o	Raw data directories migrated under 'extdata' package
	directory. The scripts that generate dataset objects from
	the raw data migrated under 'util' package directory.


DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

    o	The read.superslide() method was renamed read.singlesubgrid().



		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.3.6


NEW FEATURES

    o	Pre-Fit QC is now part of mainstream processing.

    o	Reworked internals of read.microvigene() method to try
	a backup approach if initial attempt to read datafile fails.
	This proved successful in handling datafiles with CRCRLF
	line endings on Un*x.

    o	Added read.superslide() method which can convert the
	RPPA Core Lab's single subgrid layout into its logical
	dimensions (4x12x11x11).



		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.3.5


NEW FEATURES

    o	Spatial adjustment is now part of mainstream processing.
	If not disabled, a slide design file (from SlideDesignerGUI)
	is now mandatory for processing of RPPA datafiles.

    o	RPPASet() method is now far more tolerant of bad datafiles;
	it continues processing if at all possible. As a consequence,
	results may be incomplete and should be verified.

    o	Backend changes now provide a sort of abstract progress
	monitoring. This capability will be heavily exploited by
	its sibling package (SuperCurveGUI).


BUG FIXES

    o	RPPADesignFromParams() method "sorted" the rows of the 'layout'
	slot when 'designfile' argument was given, which caused major
	problems when it came time to perform curve fitting.

    o	spatialCorrection() method did not check that the requested
	measure actually existed in the RPPA.

    o	Updated documentation in many places to account for the stricter
	checking performed by new Rd processing code in R-2.10+.



		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.3.4


NEW FEATURES

    o	If TIFF image does not exist, a "missing slide" image is
	substituted automatically when creating merged output from
	an RPPASet.

    o	Converted the write.summary method into a generic method.


BUG FIXES

    o	Image directory was mistakenly made required when creating
	settings files. Now it can also be NULL.

    o	Modified slot type for 'imgdir' slot of SuperCurveSettings
	object to allow NULL. Also added 'antibodyfile' and 'software'
	slots as these settings would be required for reproducibility
	of output using more esoteric settings.



		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.3.3


NEW FEATURES

    o	Output filenames now converted to POSIX portable filename
	when writing files to disk. Prevents names of antibodies
	from possibly being used for malicious purposes.



		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.3.2


NEW FEATURES

    o	Added the 'antibody' argument to RPPA() generator to allow
	specifying its name within the object. This change also
	impacts the RPPA class definition to add corresponding slot.

    o	Added the 'antibodyfile' argument to RPPASet() generator
	to allow antibodies to be specified when RPPA instances
	created. Antibodies are now used as rownames (rather than
	the quantification filenames) in the resulting class.

    o	Removed alias information loading code from RPPASet()
	generator. This is now handled completely by RPPADesignParams()
	generator.

    o	Multitude of small updates to the package's graphics methods.
	Plot titles standardized for all methods. Axes from image()
	methods now display tickmarks in multiples of Sub.Row and
	Sub.Col. Pointless labels removed in several places. All
	graphic output is now titled, nominally with reference to
	measure and antibody in main title, and filename in subtitle.


BUG FIXES

    o	RPPASet() generator used regular expression to determine
	quantification files to be read that included files ending
	with "txt" without being the file extension.



		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.3.1


NEW FEATURES

    o	Both RPPA() and RPPADesignParams() generators now allow
	use of absolute pathnames for file arguments. If absolute
	pathname is specified, the 'path' argument is ignored.

    o	Added 'aliasfile', 'designfile', and 'path' arguments
	to RPPADesignParams() generator and RPPADesign() method.
	The previous experimental capability to pass filename to
	'controls' argument of either function was removed in favor
	of more explicit 'designfile' argument.

    o   Added 'aliasfile' and 'designfile' slots to RPPADesignParams
        object.

    o   Modified slot types for 'alias' and 'controls' slots of
	RPPADesignParams object to allow NULL.

    o   Modified slot type for 'xform' slot of RPPAFitParams object
	to allow NULL.


BUG FIXES

    o	RPPA() generator now allows 'path' argument to be empty string.

    o	Added error checking to registerModel() method to verify
	that 'classname' argument is subclass of 'FitClass'.

    o	On Windows, calls to message() method were not being flushed;
	now progress is reported while computations are in progress.



		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.3.0


NEW FEATURES

    o	Added spatialCorrection() method to perform topographical
	adjustment for slides prior to performing fit.

    o	Added SuperCurveSettings class, generator, and
	fitCurveAndSummarizeFromSettings() method to make it simpler
	to repeat a previous analysis. This will be the new interface
	used by SuperCurveGUI package.

    o	Added initial implementation of data-driven access for
	normalize() method and FitClass model via registration. This
	provides means for user code to be incorporated into SuperCurve
	processing. This functionality is also used by SuperCurveGUI
	package.

    o	Added validity function for RPPADesign class.

    o	Added temporary capability to pass filename to 'controls'
	argument of RPPADesignParams() generator. Filename specifies
	slide design information. As such, the actual controls
	are automagically specified when RPPADesign instance is
	created. This feature should be considered experimental.

    o	Now checks the quantification data.frame from readQuantification()
	method to verify expected columns.


UTILITIES

    o	Updated scripts to create R objects from raw data provided
	with the package.


BUG FIXES

    o	Disallowed use of character vector inside list in 'controls'
        argument of RPPADesignParams() generator. Change is not
	backwards compatible.

    o	RPPA() generator now checks that both 'file' and 'path'
	arguments are not empty strings.

    o	Now checks the 'path' argument of write.summary() method to
	ensure results directory can be writable.

    o	Corrected error message in readQuantification() method that
	displayed connection number rather than the intended filename.

    o	Corrected check in readQuantification() method that was supposed
	to verify the 'tiffdir' argument was a directory.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.2.0


NEW FEATURES

    o	Modified the trimConc(FitClass) generic method to require
	additional 'trimLevel' argument (and methods for each
	provided FitClass subclasses).

    o	Modified the 'trim' argument of both RPPAFit() and
	RPPAFitParams() generators to handle passing a numeric scalar.
	This change also impacts the RPPAFitParams class definition
	as its slot there changed from logical to numeric type.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.1.0


NEW FEATURES

    o	Added first draft of spatialNorm() function for
	topographical normalization.

    o	Added 'software' argument to RPPA() and RPPASet() generators
	to enable user-defined function to handle reading data
	from quantification files.

    o	Added dim(RPPA) and dim(RPPADesign) methods which return
	the slide layout dimensions.

    o	Updated the summary(RPPA), summary(RPPADesign), and
	summary(RPPAFit) methods to produce better summary information.
	Removed summary(RPPAFitParams) method as output was sometimes
	incorrect depending on how object was created.

    o	Added 'call' slot to RPPADesign object.

    o	Added metadata from the quantification file to the RPPA
	'data' slot object.

    o	Updated tests for FitClass derived objects such that they
	now require that SUPERCURVE_FULL_TEST environment variable
	be defined. This was done in an effort to reduce the time
	required to run R CMD check for the package.

    o	Modified code such that the RPPADesignParams() generator
	now allows the 'controls' argument to also be specified
	as a character vector.

    o	Vignette updated to current code.


BUG FIXES

    o	Merging output graphs by write.summary() method (which requires
	ImageMagick's 'convert') now works correctly on Windows platform.

    o	Plots generated by write.summary() method are now created on
	white background. The original code was "copying" the screen
	device to create the PNG files; since most screen devices
	default to a transparent background, the resulting plots (and
	merged output graph) were hard to read when generated on certain
	platforms (depending on default device).

    o	Corrected code within RPPASet() generator to handle directory
	with no quantification files and handle bad/invalid layout
	information file.

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.0.1


NEW FEATURES

    o	Added additional information to summary(RPPAFit) method.


BUG FIXES

    o	Corrected code responsible for fitting the dilution series
	so that the regression method now actually invokes the
	function representing the model for the slide (evaulation
	occurring in wrong environment).

    o	Patched code such that image(RPPAFit) method could be found
	when called from write.summary() function.

    o	Fixed refactoring bug in RPPADesign() generator dealing with
	alias defaults.

    o	Modified tests to use fewer digits for better cross-platform
	compatibility.

	it's more likely to actually be drawn in smaller window sizes.

    o	Much more error checking for bad arguments in all functions.

    o	RPPA() generator now allows 'file' argument to be a connection.

    o	Tcl/Tk GUI is now in its own package SuperCurveGUI.


BUG FIXES

    o	Updated dataset objects to R-2.7.

    o   Removed slot 'p.values' included in RPPAFit objects as it
	wasn't being used.

    o	Fixed plots for RPPAFit objects so that the various 'type'
	arguments now work as expected.

    o	Fixed warnings about graphical parameters that came from running
	write.summary() function.

    o	Identifies if non-MicroVigene datafile is passed to RPPA() generator.

    o	Checks that 'measure' argument to image(RPPA) method specifies
	a valid column name from its 'data' slot.
